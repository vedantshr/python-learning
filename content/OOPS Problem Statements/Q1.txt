Create an Employee Salary mgmt system

1. Create a class EMployee with the following attributes, empId (int), empName(string), empDomain(string , only "IT" and "HR"), empWorkHours(float), empSalary(float, default=0.0)

2. Create another class Salary with attributes, companyName(string, default="TCS"), empList (list if employee objects )

Salary class should have 2 methods,

i) setSalary which should accept empSalId (integer), representing empId. This function should set the value of empSalary for the employee with matching id.

Salary is calculated as: For IT domain, fixed salary is 20000 and for HR domain fixedd salary is 14000.
Over the fixed salary, employees are paid according to the work hours. For each hour they are paid 500.

The function should return the object for employee whose salary has been calculated. Return None if employee not found

ii) deleteEmployee, should accept an integer representing delEmpId. The employee object matching this empId should be removed form the list of employee objects (empList).

function should return a dictionary with key as empId and value as empName for the employee removed. If no employee found for given id then function should return None.


For main function:

take inputs, create objects and call both functions.
print result of the first function attribute wise
(Eg. 
11
Aditya
IT
23
31500
), print None if not found.
Result of next function should be returned as
(Eg. {22:Diksha} ), print None if not found.


Sample Input:

first line contains number of employees to be added
next lines in pair of 4 contain each employee's details in the order -> empId, empName, empDomain, empWorkHours
next comes the employee id for which salary has to be calculated
last line contains id of employee to be removed
