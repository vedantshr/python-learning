Everything in Python is an Object, every variable holds an object instance. When an object is initiated, it is assigned a unique object id. Its type is defined at runtime and once set can never change, however its state can be changed if it is mutable. Simple put, a mutable object can be changed after it is created, and an immutable object can’t.
Objects of built-in types like (int, float, bool, str, tuple, unicode) are immutable. Objects of built-in types like (list, set, dict) are mutable.
